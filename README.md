8 How I became an ethical hacker
I began my cybersecurity journey with a thirst for knowledge and a determination to succeed. After passing my 5 exams, I came across a video on Termux and was immediately drawn to the world of hacking. Despite not having a phone, I had computer skills and an Android TV, so I started learning the basics of Linux using my TV, but with limited time due to family members using the TV for entertainment. However, I was not discouraged, and I took the time to write down the commands I learned in a notebook so I could refer to them later.

After completing Class 8, I invested in a second-hand computer with an i3 6100 processor and 4 GB of RAM, which became my tool for learning ethical hacking. Despite the various real-life challenges I faced, including a nose and tonsil operation in Class 6, I continued to push forward and deepen my knowledge. I relied on YouTube and Google as my primary sources of learning, and through my hard work and dedication, I was able to turn my passion for cybersecurity into a successful career as an ethical hacker.

This journey was not easy, and there were times when I felt like giving up. But my love for cybersecurity and my determination to succeed kept me going. Now, I am proud to be a successful ethical hacker, and I am eager to share my story with others as a source of inspiration and motivation.
